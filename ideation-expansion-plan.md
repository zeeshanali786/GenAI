# GenAI Project Expansion Plan

This project aims to evolve the current **GenAI** platform into a fully scalable, high-performance Generative AI system, capable of handling multiple LLMs (Large Language Models) and supporting conversational AI workflows. Below is a detailed plan for expanding the project and the technical vision for creating a complete, cloud-agnostic AI/ML platform.

## Project Expansion Steps

### **Phase 1: Initial Expansion & Integration**
In this phase, the  focus on integrating multiple LLMs and setting up the basic infrastructure to handle conversational agents.

1. **Extend Model Support**:
   - Integrate additional LLMs such as **GPT**, **Claude**, via APIs (HuggingFace, OpenAI).
   - Ensure support for different models to handle various conversational tasks, including context generation, summarization, and sentiment analysis.

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Modify the backend to handle multiple conversational agents, each interacting with different LLMs.
   - Implement a dynamic agent selection system to route conversations to the most appropriate model based on user queries.

3. **Memory and Context Management**:
   - Need to figure out the possible tooling around how to manage the context conversational memory. Sliding window is a custom approach which may work in POC mode, but what is out there as a proper scaleable solution for memory and embedding persistance/cache
   - Design a path for langer conversation, what is gonna be the solution

### **Phase 2: Scalable Infrastructure & Real-Time Data**
The second phase focuses on setting up a scalable infrastructure, enabling real-time data streaming, and supporting model fine-tuning.

1. **GPU-Powered Inference**:
   - Set up cloud services such as **AWS Sagemaker** or  to deploy models and enable GPU-powered inference.
   -  AWS does prodive a free tier for sage maker, may be a good idea to use it, other wise have to rely on local labtop etc


2. **Fine-Tuning Models**:
   - Develop a pipeline for fine-tuning models based on user interaction data.
   - Allow continuous learning and improvement of conversational agents by adapting to user feedback.

---

### **Phase 3: Full AI/ML Platform**
In this phase,  the  aim shold be to establish the platform as a complete AI/ML system, with a focus on model training, deployment, and scalability.

1. **Real-Time Model Training**:
   - Integrate real-time model training pipelines that can continuously improve the models based on new user interactions and data.
   - Use frameworks like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, or **MLflow** to manage training and model versioning.

2. **Containerization & Kubernetes**:
   - Use **Docker** to containerize the backend services and models. It is already like that, but need to enhance the docker-compose so one click infra should be up

### **Phase 4: Monitoring & Evaluation**
Figure out  and dicvover the niche monitoring tooling around for GenAI and AI Agent OS, other then typical cloud provider offering.

1. **Model Performance Tracking**:
   - Integrate model performance metrics tracking, including **loss**, **accuracy**, and inference speed.
   - Implement real-time evaluation systems to monitor and optimize model outputs during production use.

## End goal for delerable to get end to end hands-on exp

1. **Working project, **:
   - A   project with portable platform, covering tech capabilities like:
     - Support for multiple LLMs (GPT, Claude, Mistral).
     - Fine-tuned models tailored for specific use cases.
     - Real-time conversational agents with memory and contextual awareness.


## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java, Python, ollma4j, llma4j, OpenAI SDK
- **Models**: GPT, Claude, Mistral, HuggingFace, OpenAI API, and Predictive models for custom data set clustering etc
- **Context Storage**: tbd, need to figure out,
